TITLE - "GO RIDE - A RIDE MATCHING SYSTEM"
GoRide is a C++-based ride-hailing simulation system that connects riders with nearby available drivers based on shortest path and vehicle preference. The city is modeled as a graph, and Dijkstra’s algorithm is used to find optimal routes. Features include real-time driver matching, dynamic fare calculation, driver availability management, ride receipts, and user feedback.

 ->Key Features:
 
->Vehicle type selection (Bike, Auto, Car, SUV)
->Shortest path calculation using Dijkstra’s algorithm
->Distance-based fare with multipliers
->Driver stats and availability
->ASCII city map visualization
->Rider feedback & rating system
